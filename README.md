# House Price Predictor

## Whatâ€™s This?

This project predicts house prices based on features like living area, number of bedrooms, and year built. It uses a simple linear regression model to estimate prices from a dataset.

## How It Works

1. **Load Data**: Reads the dataset from `train.csv`.
2. **Prepare Data**: Fills missing values with column means.
3. **Train Model**: Uses Linear Regression to train on selected features.
4. **Evaluate**: Measures model performance and displays results.
5. **Visualize**: Plots actual vs. predicted prices.

## Running the Code

1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

2. Place `train.csv` in the same directory.

3. Run the script to train the model and see the results.
